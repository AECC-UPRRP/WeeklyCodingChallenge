Challenge Week 1
================

_Welcome to the AECC's First Weekly programing challenge, the first of many we hope. :)_

To complete this challenge you are required to learn a little bit of the Functional Language know as Haskell.

For begginers: 
* For this challenge you must create a function that when given a non-empty list returns the sum of its values.

For intermediates:
* Function must generate a list of even numbers and use the first 5 to calculate their sum.

For advanced:
* Function must efficiently generate fibonacci numbers and take and arbitraty amount (between 1 and 10) randomly selected on each run to sum that amount of elements from the list.
